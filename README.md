# banking-software-with-python

A banking software would likely require the following components:

Database: A database would be needed to store information about customers, accounts, transactions, etc. This could be implemented using SQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
User Interface: The software would need a user interface that allows customers to interact with their accounts, check their balance, make deposits and withdrawals, and view their transaction history. This could be a web interface or a desktop application.
API: A backend API would be needed to handle requests from the user interface, process transactions, and interact with the database. This could be implemented using a framework like Flask or Django.
